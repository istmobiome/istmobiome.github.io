In this repo you will find the source code for my CV. I made it with the R package [**pagedown**](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown). Some of the code is borrowed from (Nick Strayer's)[http://nickstrayer.me] [**repo**](https://github.com/nstrayer/cv). You should chheck this out because he does a data driven cv. I did not do this for mine but it does look rad. He also has a really nice site with a lot of tutorials on data visualization and a blog called [Live Free or Dichotomize](https://livefreeordichotomize.com/). 

Good stuff.
