This repo contains source code for a presentation that I gave on Fermentation as part of the Darklands Foundation Comprehensive Seminar on Cacao Production. 

The talk can be found here:

https://istmobiome.github.io/cacao/talk.html#/

The presentation is written in [R Markdown Format for reveal.js Presentations](https://github.com/rstudio/revealjs). The presentation contains the following features:

> - Some interactive components written in R.  
> - A nested, 2D structure meaning main ideas run horizontally & sub ideas run vertically.  
> - To see all the sildes in the **Slide Overview** mode Press `ESC` button. 
> - In OSX hold down the `option` key (ctrl in Linux) & click on any element to zoom towards it using.   
> - To enter presenter mode with notes press the `S` key. Notes do not seem to work on level 1 headers (h1) and at present there are no notes. That may change
> - To enter full screen press `F` key.  
> - Navigation buttons and slide number in bottom right.  
> - Chalkboard, marker, & menu buttons in bottom left. 

The end of the presentation contains a Resource section that highlights some of the primary liturature I used as well as various tools and other resources.
