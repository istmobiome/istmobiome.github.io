Roughly 3 million years ago, a spectacular natural experiment began when the Isthmus of Panama finally closed, a geologic process that began many million years earlier. 

On land,  the formation of the Isthmus connected North &amp; South America, and ushered in one of the greatest episode of migration in earth’s history—
The Great American Biotic Interchange—Many of the mammal species we see today arrived during this event. 

However, what was a bridge on land became a barrier in the ocean. 

Where once a single tropical ocean flowed, two distinct marine environments formed when the Isthmus closed. 

Strikingly different physicochemical conditions persist in these two oceans today &amp; these differences are reflected in the communities adapted to live there. 

So for marine organisms the story unfolded quite differently. The barrier separated populations, leading to speciation for some &amp; local extinction for many others.

When I think about the formation of the Isthmus I think about the contrasting elements behind this events. 

For organisms the most important contrast is evolution and diversification vs. extinction 
and what drives these processes are the physical and geological changes that took place
during the formation of the Isthmus.

On the other hand, one ocean split in two resulting in two vastly different marine environments.

# .large[How] did we get .large[here]?

???
So how did we get from one ocean to two, and from two continents to essentially one? 

In order to understand why the rise of the Isthmus was such an important event we must first understand what the stage looked like before this event. 

We’ll start by looking at continental drift and plate tectonics, because as you may know, land masses have not always been where they are today 
And they are always moving, albeit excrusiatilgy slow, over the earth’s mantle. 
And this movement is how we got to the isthmus.

As the theory goes, 225mya all 7 major continents and the Indian subcontinent were part of a supercontinent called Pangaea. 

Some 25my later this land mass began to split into two, Laurasia in the north comprising modern day Europe, North America and Asia
And Gondwanaland in the south comprising S. America, Africa, Australia, Antarctica, and the Indian subcontinent. 

And by 100 mya S. America and Africa had completely separated from each other while N. America was still connected to Eurasia. 
SA remained  connected with Ant and Aust. 50 mya Patagonia had many plant species that are now restricted to Australia meaning there
Must have been a frost free corridor through Antarctica connecting SA and Australia. 

However by 40 mya but SA finally separated from ANT and AUST and for 
the next 35 million years was an island continent and the animals there—a mixture of Australian and Africa decent—evolved in complete isolation.

???
The contrast with N. America was remarkable. During this same time NA was a larger continent intermittently connected to Eurasia (itself intermittently connected to Africa). Rather than evolving in isolation, N. A. Mammals were constantly tested by encounters with a wider variety of competitors. The result was a competitive advantage over their SA counterparts. 

As a result NA mammals spread widely, diversified greatly, and steadily replaced the many native SA animals after the land bridge formed. 

Although invaders crossed in both directions, SA mammals were much less successful.

Ok, so lets take a look at the groups of mammals that migrated from South to North. 
We will focus on land mammals because the fossil record is much richer and easier to interpret but please remember that birds, plants, reptiles and insects also migrated across the new land bridge.

The spectacled bear is the only bear native to South America and is the largest land carnivore on that part of the continent, although as little as 5% of its diet is composed of meat. 

South America's largest obligate carnivorous mammal is the jaguar (Panthera onca). Both from NA

Ok, so this is a graph showing the number of mammal genera migrating to and from each continent across time. The top panel shows the number of migrants from SA to NA, and the bottom from NA to SA. 

So for example if we look at the bar between 2 and 1 mya, we see that over 20 mammal groups went N to S and 3 went from S. To N. 

The main message here is that the vast majority of migrations occurred after 3mya suggesting that prior to this time there was no continuous passage. However we can also see that there are several instances of migrations before the proposed formation of the isthmus

So this is a cell phone video taken in 2010 by the son of one of STRI’s scientists. This is the charges river where it flows into the Panama canal near Gamboa after an exceptionally large storm. The river is totally swole. The bridge that you will see by the way is over 100 years old. 

What you see are several large pieces of land moving downriver.

As I mentioned at the start what happened in the sea was very different compared to what happened on land. Here the bridge became a barrier effectively cutting off all gene flow between once connected populations and causing local extinction of many species.

At the start of the Micocene ~20 mya a common marine assemblage of plants and animals extended from western Mexico and Ecuador in the Pacific to Trinidad and Cuba in the Atlantic thanks to deep water connections between N. And S. America. This biota evolved independently from that in the Indo-Pacific, an area encompassing tropical waters stretching from Hawaii through Aust., Indonesia, and India, all the way to the E. Coast of africa.

By 12 mya the land bridge was almost complete possibly allowing some small scale interchange between N and SA. At this time the isthmus was a peninsula of NA yet a deep water passage still existed between N and SA.

And by 4mya the narrowing seaway began to diminish Caribbean upwelling and the final closure extinguish upwelling in the caribbean. Turns out that Seasonal upwelling plays an important role in this part of the story. So lets talk about this for a minute

### Caused seasonal Upwelling in the Eastern Pacific.

???
Upwelling is an oceanographic phenomenon that involves wind-driven motion that moves away warmer, usually nutrient-depleted surface water, allowing dense, cooler, and usually nutrient-rich deeper water towards the ocean surface. 

The nutrient-rich upwelled water stimulates the growth and reproduction of primary producers such as phytoplankton—single celled plants that float in the upper water column and use sunlight to generate oxygen and fix carbon dioxide that is used by animals further up the food chain.

In Panama, seasonal winds move from North to South especially in the east where mountains are relatively low causing upwelling in the bay of Panama 

The nutrient-rich upwelled water stimulates the growth and reproduction of primary producers such as phytoplankton—single celled plants that float in the upper water column and use sunlight to generate oxygen and fix carbon dioxide that is used by animals further up the food chain.

During upwelling events temperatures can drop by up to 10C
