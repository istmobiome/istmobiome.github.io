This repo contains individual web packages with the root URL https://istmobiome.github.io/. There **isn't a home page** at this address and if you try to access it you will see a puppy who will suggest you  visit https://istmobiome.rbind.io/.

There is a reason I did it this way. Using `.github.io` allows me to create standalone web projects without needing to intergrate into a main site or  rebuild a site each time I add anything new, etc. I use  different R Markdown packages for different projects and didn't want to incorporate them all together. Probably a much better way but at the moment this approach is much quicker for me. Most of the material here is linked on the main project website, https://istmobiome.rbind.io/.
